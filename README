Slamhound integration for vim.

First install:

        slamhound:      https://github.com/technomancy/slamhound
        fireplace.vim:  https://github.com/tpope/vim-fireplace

If you are running Vim 7.3.802 or earlier, then you will also need to install
the Clojure runtime files:

        https://github.com/guns/vim-clojure-static

Then from a Clojure buffer run:

        :Slamhound

No mappings are supplied, but a useful mapping may be:

        nnoremap <LocalLeader>sh :Slamhound<CR>

A function, slamhound#reconstruct(file, textwidth), is available for more
granular control.
